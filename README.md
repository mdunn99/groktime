# GrokTime - Dynamic Grokker
Using the power of OpenAI's GPT-5-mini, this library dynamically writes Grok patterns to an adjustable config file to make the process of log ingestion easier. This library was built to support my UCF Knight Hacks project: "Vigil" (a work in progress SIEM).

## Core Features
- A preset list of common Grok patterns in common log formats (generated by GPT-5-mini)
- Neglgible compute/API cost for writing new Grok patterns
- Configurable variable names

## Dependencies
- `pygrok`
- `openai`
- `watchdog`

## Use
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/mdunn99/groktime.git`
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Create a `.env` file in your project folder and add your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY_HERE>`
4. Install the dependencies: `pip install pygrok openai watchdog`
5. Run: `python3 main.py -l LOG_FILE`

## Working on:
- Reading log entry by timestamp rather than by newline
- More robust decision tree
- Support for Web API calls
- Asynchronous pattern writing with streaming
- Add more datetime formats
